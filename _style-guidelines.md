# Hijack Security Blog - Style Guidelines

## Blog Design Philosophy

This blog maintains a **professional, technical aesthetic** focused on security, development, and infrastructure topics. The design prioritizes readability, scanability, and professional appearance over visual decoration.

## Formatting Standards

### Emoji Usage
- **Minimal and purposeful only** - use sparingly for section headers when it adds genuine value
- **Maximum 1-2 emojis per heading** when used
- **Avoid decorative emojis** in body text and bullet points
- **Professional context** - only use when appropriate for technical content

### Heading Structure
- Use standard markdown hierarchy: `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections
- Keep headings clean and descriptive
- Avoid excessive visual decoration in headings

### Text Formatting
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key concepts and terms
- Use *italics* for quotes, notes, and subtle emphasis
- Use `code formatting` for technical terms, commands, and file names
- Use standard markdown formatting over HTML when possible

### Lists and Bullets
- Use clean bullet points with **bold** keywords followed by descriptions
- Keep bullet points scannable and concise
- Avoid emojis in bullet points unless absolutely necessary

### Code Blocks
- Use proper language specification for syntax highlighting
- Include clear, practical examples
- Add comments when helpful for understanding

### Links
- Use descriptive link text
- Format as `[descriptive text](url)` in standard markdown
- Avoid "click here" or generic link text

## Content Structure

### Post Layout
1. **Clear introduction** explaining what the post covers
2. **Logical section flow** with descriptive headings
3. **Practical examples** and code when relevant
4. **Clear conclusion** with next steps or key takeaways

### Technical Content
- **Security-focused perspective** throughout
- **Production-ready examples** over toy demonstrations
- **Real-world context** and practical applications
- **Clear explanations** of technical concepts

## Visual Elements

### Images
- Use images purposefully to illustrate concepts
- Include descriptive alt text
- Use consistent styling when adding custom HTML

### HTML Usage
- Keep custom HTML minimal
- Use only when markdown is insufficient
- Maintain consistent styling patterns
- Focus on functionality over decoration

## Consistency Examples

### Good Examples (Follow These Patterns)

- **Network Security** - Implement security groups and network policies
- **Monitoring Setup** - Enable comprehensive logging and metrics

```bash
# Configure the cluster
eksctl create cluster --config-file cluster.yaml
```
